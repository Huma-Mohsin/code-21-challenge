// //Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

//solution.

//An enum, short for "enumeration," is a data type in many programming languages used to define a set of named constants. These constants are typically used to represent a fixed number of possible values that a variable can take. Enumerations provide a way to make code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone by giving meaningful names to values.

//Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums.

enum vehicles {
  cars,
  trucks,
  motorcycles,
  aeroplane,
  train,
  bicycles,
}
console.log("\n");
//show one example.
console.log("In Vehicles variable,train is stored at Index",vehicles.train); //shows the index that in vehicles variable,train is placed at 4 index.
console.log("\n");

console.log("In Vehicles variable,train is stored at Index",vehicles.motorcycles);
